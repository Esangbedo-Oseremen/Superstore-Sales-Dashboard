# Superstore Sales Analysis

### Project Overview

I created a dashboard to analyze sales data from a fictional retail store called superstore.The goal was to understand which products, regions,and customer types brings in the most sales and how sales change overtime, and gain deeper understanding of the store's performance.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analyasis is the "superstore_dataset.csv", it includes customer orders with details like order date, sales amount, shipping information, product category, and customer location.

### Tools

- Excel - To clean and prepare the data.
- PowerBI - To build interactive dashboards and visuals.


### What I Did (Step-by-Step):

1. Loaded the data into Excel and cleaned it by:
- Doing data inspection
- Checking for missing or duplicate entries
- Ensuring date formats were correct
- Ensuring data type were accurate

2. Imported the cleaned data into power BI	
            
3. Created KPIs like Total Sales,Total Orders,and Average Sales Per Customer	

4. Built visuals such as:
 - Bar charts for top products and regional sales
 - Line charts to show sales trends over time
 - Pie chart for sales per segment

  5. Added filters and slicers for interactive exploration

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as

- What are the top 10 best-selling products?
- Which category made the most money?
- Which segment had the highest sales?
- Which region performed best in sales?
- What are the yearly sales trends?
     
 ### Results/Findings:

1. Technology was the top-performing product category
2. West region had the highest overall sales
3. Consumer segment accounted for most of the sales
4. 2018 recorded the highest sales over time

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest more in Technology Products
- Expand operations or marketing in the West
- Put more focus on the Consumer Segment
- Focus on sustaining peak sales levels

### Why This Project Matters:

This dashboard helps the business quickly understand what is driving sales, who their top customers are, and where to focus efforts for better performance.
